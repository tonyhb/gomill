# Gomill V0 #
V0 is the initial version of Gomill being developed. It's exctracted from a personal site, so nowehre near feature complete or API stable. In fact, right now you can only create transactions from the web form...

### Plan

Gomill is at the very start of its life... there's a long way to go and much to do yet.

- A simple, easy to use, consolidated API: `Gomill.New("API Key").Create(&Transaction{...})` to create a transaction, `Gomill.New("API Key").List("transactions")` to list transactions. The API __isn't__ like this yet.
- Full unit test coverage.
